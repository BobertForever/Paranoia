Paranoia
========

Preface
------
Paranoia was my first personal project and was one of my starting points in CS. By my current standards (and standards of any onlookers), this project is pretty awful. It's riddled with every type of security exploit known, and doesn't abide by any sane coding standards.

Thank being said, it was my first project, and has a special place on my Github because of that.

To setup
--------

* Create a user and a database in SQL, and add that data to the configuration file.
* Run the setup_database.php script to setup the tables in the database. (NOT YET INCLUDED)
* Setup a Twilio account and add the correct information into the configuration file.
* Download the Twilio PHP API Libraries and put the Services folder in the lib directory.
* Setup a bitly account and put the access token in the configuration file. (It is recommended, but not necessary, to change the default short domain to j.mp under settings)
* Add the correct URL or IP to the correct field in the configuration file.
